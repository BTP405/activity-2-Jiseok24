# Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.
#Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
#What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?



#Approach 1
    # Function doubleL(n)
        # It takes an integer "n" as input
        # Initialize an empty list "res"
        # Iterate "res.append(i * 2)" from i = 0 to i = n-1
        # return res
    # For loop
        # Iterate "print(i, end=' : ')" from i = 0 to "doubleL(5)"

#Approach 2
    # For loop
        # Iterate "print(x, end=' : ')" from x = 0 to [n * 2 for n in range(5)]
        # generates a list containing double of each number in the range from 0 to 4

#Approach 3
    # Function doubleG(n)
        # It takes an integer n as input
        # It iterates over the range from 0 to n-1
        # For each iteration, it yields the double of the current index i
    # For loop
        # It iterates over the elements yielded by the generator function doubleG(5)

#With yield, you yield code execution outside the function, passing the value out of the function. Thus yield pauses the current function and makes the code outside the function run.
